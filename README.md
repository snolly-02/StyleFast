# StyleFast
Led an HCI (Humanâ€“Computer Interaction) project for StyleFast, an AI-driven fashion styling app.  Applied 10 Usability Heuristics to assess and enhance the overall user experience.  Designed and iterated Lo-Fi and Hi-Fi prototypes, integrating user feedback to refine the interface and flow.
